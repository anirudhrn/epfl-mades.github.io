We are looking to hire talented and motivated researchers. Hiring is done throughout the year at MADES. Please read the information on this page carefully before applying for a position in the laboratory.

### Doctoral Students & Postdoctoral researchers

Doctoral students in the laboratory are expected to have a deep understanding of the fundamentals of materials science. Some experience in the application of computational techniques to solve problems in materials science is beneficial. Applicants for a graduate position are encouraged to first apply to the [doctoral program](https://www.epfl.ch/education/phd/edmx-materials-science-and-engineering/) before reaching out to the laboratory. Applicants are typically expected to have (or be close to receiving) a masters degree. Exceptional candidates with only a bachelors degree may be considered on a case by case basis.

Postdoctoral researchers are expected to be well-versed in applying computational methods to build materials models. Successful candidates will have the opportunity to lead projects that combine first-principles calculations, machine-learning and statistical mechanics techniques to design and discover novel materials and processing techniques. The ideal candidate should have a passion for applying cutting edge research techniques across research domains. Postdoctoral scholars are expected to have good programming skills, experience with high-throughput computing and a solid knowledge of advanced concepts in materials science, machine-learning and statistical mechanics methods.

To apply for a postdoctoral or graduate student position please send your application to this [e-mail address](mailto:anirudh.natarajan@epfl.ch?subject=*RECRUITMENT*). Your application should contain:
- a recent CV (including publication list, and full academic transcripts)
- contact information of two references
- brief cover letter explaining your interest in MADES and how your profile fits our research goals

### Funding Opportunities

### Opportunities for students at EPFL
MADES offers several semester and thesis projects to **masters students** at EPFL. The goals of the masters projects are tailored to individual student interests and the current topics of interest to the laboratory. Masters students that are interested in pursuing a semester project with MADES are encouraged to have:
- A basic understanding of working in a `UNIX` environment. Consider installing a Linux distribution if you are unfamiliar with this. 
- Elementary skills in any programming language such as `python`, `C++`, `julia` etc.
- Well-versed in physics, mathematics and chemistry at the undergraduate level. 
Please send an e-mail with your CV to [this address](mailto:anirudh.natarajan@epfl.ch?subject=*Masters Project*) if you are interested in pursuing a masters project in MADES for the upcoming semester.
