  description: Yann received a Master’s degree in Materials Science and Engineering from the EPFL in 2021. After working for one year at the EMPA laboratory for Advanced Processing and Additive Manufacturing, he began a Ph.D. in Materials Science in the MADES laboratory in 2022. In his project, he employs first-principles electronic structure calculations and statistical mechanics techniques to elucidate precipitation mechanisms in refractory high entropy alloys. Specifically, he analyzes the formation of ordered precipitates from disordered solid solutions using computational methods. He constructs atomistic models to guide experimentalists in identifying alloys with optimal mechanical properties.

  description: Deepak graduated from the Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur (IIT KGP) in 2023 with a Bachelor's in Mechanical Engineering and a Master's in Thermal Science and Engineering. He is working on generating methodologies to predict the properties of metallic alloys. Currently, he is working on a project to build a model that predicts the segregation energy values for bi-metallic alloys using the local environment descriptors of grain-boundary atoms.
